      <h1>Hello, I'm <span>Bayya Maniteja</span></h1>
      <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Technology (B.Tech) with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). Alongside my academic journey, I am passionate about web development, with a strong focus on front-end development. I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites using modern technologies.

        I am also the founder of the Classic Coder community, where I actively engage with like-minded individuals to share knowledge and foster learning. Currently, I am working as an intern at TEAM MREC, where I am gaining valuable industry experience and contributing to exciting projects. My aim is to continuously grow, both as a web developer and as a professional in the AI/ML domain, and to create impactful technological solutions.</p>
